This project is for managing CNN Employess. 

I have created this project using Express.JS application.

Project involves signUp page, Login Page, Records, Insert Employee page, News Page.

I have used NewsAPI in news page.

I am fetching JSON data from the API and shoing news with proper formate in news.pub.

All the connections are available in index.js files.
